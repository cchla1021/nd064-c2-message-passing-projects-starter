I use gRPC for microrserver message passing because quick response, request time, and popular message passing for microservice. 
For frontend, I still keep REST as most external clients know how to communicate with HTTP RESTful service.
Kafka is a special type of message queue that is often used to handle large volumes of data generated continuously as events.
Large volume of location data will be generated from each event attendees mobile devices, therefore, Kafka shoule be good fit for this application.
