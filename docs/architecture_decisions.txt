#Justification of decisions:
For frontend, I still keep REST as most external clients know how to communicate with HTTP RESTful service.
Due to a lot of users' mobile devices will push their current locations data to location route, therefore, gRPC is used because REST will not be able to handle large volume of data and may causing delay even timeout.
gRPC server will be implemented in the location route as a producer because quick response/request time and recommended use with microservice application. Location service will be kafka consumer.
